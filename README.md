**Idea:**

The fundamental idea is to implement an image editor application completely written in Java from scratch. We aim to implement some basic features that are offered by the conventional imag

e-editing applications (e.g., Picsart, Adobe Photoshop). The features would allow the user to adjust different properties of the image, correct the image manually with certain tools, and add a variety of special effects to the subject image.

**Motivation:**

"In pursuit of achieving something unique," would be the one-liner motivation for us. We have explored many concepts for this project and discussed them with members of our community.

We have come to a realization that for the majority of individuals here, the word "Java Project" relates only to games and management applications. However, we know that Java is more powerful than being confined to a collection of management apps that could be developed just as well in C/C++ and would probably run great even without a graphical user interface.

We were looking for something novel that would demand a stronger mastery of the language and its associated libraries. Implementing an Image Editor application proved to be the ideal choice for us.

Understanding image processing is crucial for any route of software development since every piece of software we use on a daily basis incorporates graphical data. While working on this project, we will learn about various graphics-related Java libraries, gain practical experience with various event handler operations (as Image Editing requires extremely precise mouse selection and there are numerous popular keyboard shortcuts), and most importantly, gain the confidence that comes with completing a project that looks exactly like a widely used application in our daily lives.

**Basic Features:**



1. Displaying any Image Stored In Device
2. Brightness and Contrast Adjustments 
3. Resize
4. Crop
5. Blur
6. Draw on Image
7. Add Text
8. Applying Effects on Image
9. Save Final Image
